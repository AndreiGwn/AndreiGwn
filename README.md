- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndreiGwn, I am 19 years old and I am currently working on some school projects.
- 👀 I’m interested in making websites and game on differnet apps such as Unity (probably Unreal Engine 5 later on) and WordPress (just started learning it for future occasions or jobs).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make fun games on Unity, using codes such as C# for games, PhP, HTML/CSS/SCSS in order to make websites.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating more fun games and making websites whenever I am free most of my time.
- 📫 How to reach me: Andrei.gogan1@gmail.com (Personal account).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you ever get a merge conflict on some codes, you can just easily recopy the new code which had the conflict and copy & paste it on the old merge conflicted code. (Found this out myself)
